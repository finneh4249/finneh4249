# Welcome to Jacob Gillan's GitHub Profile!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ethan, also known as finneh4249! I'm a passionate developer working on innovative projects. My work involves creating engaging and functional software that resonates with users.

ðŸš€ Currently, I'm focused on developing [PokerBo](https://github.com/finneh4249/pokerbo), a unique blend of Poker and SicBo, [City Loopers](https://github.com/cityloopers/CityLoopersMC), and [Aometry](https://github.com/cityloopers/Aometry), a versatile Discord bot designed to enhance user experience. I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and strategies to push the boundaries of what's possible in software development.

ðŸ“« Reach out to me at mail@finneh.xyz for collaborations or just to say hi.
